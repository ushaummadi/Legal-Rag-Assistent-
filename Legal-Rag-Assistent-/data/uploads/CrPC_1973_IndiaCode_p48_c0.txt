for endorsement either to an Executive Magistrate or to a police officer not below the rank of an officer in charge of
a police station, within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the warrant is to be executed.
(2) Such Magistrate or police officer shall endorse his name thereon and such endorsement shall be sufficient
authority to the police officer to whom the warrant is directed to execute the same, and the local police shall, if so
required, assist such officer in executing such warrant.
(3) Whenever there is reason to believe that the delay occasioned by obtaining the endorsement of the
Magistrate or police officer within whose local jurisdiction the warrant is to be executed will prevent such
execution, the police officer to whom it is directed may execute the same without such endorsement in any place
beyond the local jurisdiction of the Court which issued it.
80. Procedure on arrest of person against whom warrant issued.—When a warrant of arrest is executed
outside the district in which it was issued, the person arrested shall, unless the Court which issued the warrant is
within thirty kilometres of the place of arrest or is nearer than the Executive Magistrate or District Superintendent
of Police or Commissioner of Police within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the arrest was made, or unless
security is taken under section 71, be taken before such Magistrate or District Superintendent or Commissioner.
81. Procedure by Magistrate before whom such person arrested is brought.—(1) The Executive Magistrate
or District Superintendent of Police or Commissioner of Police shall, if the person arrested appears to be the person
intended by the Court which issued the warrant, direct his removal in custody to such Court:
Provided that, if the offence is bailable, and such person is ready and willing to give bail to the satisfaction of
such Magistrate, District Superintendent or Commissioner, or a direction has been endorsed under section 71 on the
warrant and such person is ready and willing to give the security required by such direction, the Magistrate, District
Superintendent or Commissioner shall take such bail or security, as the case may be, and forward the bond, to the
Court which issued the warrant:
Provided further that if the offence is a non-bailable one, it shall be lawful for the Chief Judicial Magistrate
(subject to the provisions of section 437), or the Sessions Judge, of the district in which the arrest is made on
consideration of the information and the documents referred to in sub-section (2) of section 78, to release such
person on bail.
(2) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent a police officer from taking security under section 71.
C.—Proclamation and attachment
82. Proclamation for person absconding.—(1) If any Court has reason to believe (whether after taking
evidence or not) that any person against whom a warrant has been issued by it has absconded or is concealing
himself so that such warrant cannot be executed, such Court may publish a written proclamation requiring him to
appear at a specified place and at a specified time not less than thirty days from the date of publishing such
proclamation.
(2) The proclamation shall be published as follows:—
(i) (a) it shall be publicly read in some conspicuous place of the town or village in which such person
ordinarily resides;
(b) it shall be affixed to some conspicuous part of the house or homestead in which such person ordinarily
resides or to some conspicuous place of such town or village;
(c) a copy thereof shall be affixed to some conspicuous part of the Court-house;
(ii) the Court may also, if it thinks fit, direct a copy of the proclamation to be published in a daily
newspaper circulating in the place in which such person ordinarily resides.
(3) A statement in writing by the Court issuing the proclamation to the effect that the proclamation was duly
published on a specified day, in the manner specified in clause (i) of sub-section (2), shall be conclusive evidence
that the requirements of this section have been complied with, and that the proclamation was published on such day.
