is made under this Code against a party and there upon any judgment is pronounced against such party

not have been made and the judgment should not have been pronounced.
(2) In an appeal against a decree passed in a suit after recording a compromise or refusing to record a

8[2. Grant of time for payment of court-fee.—Where an application is rejected under rule 1, the Court
may, while rejecting the application, allow the applicant to pay the requisite Court-fee, within such time as
may be fixed by the Court or extended by it from time to time; and upon such payment, the memorandum of
appeal in respect of which such fee is payable shall have the same force and effect as if such fee had been
paid in the first instance.
3. Inquiry as to whether applicant is an indigent person.—(1) Where an applicant, referred to in
rule 1, was allowed to sue or appeal as an indigent person in the Court from whose decree the appeal is
preferred, no further inquiry in respect of the question whether or not he is an indigent person shall be
necessary if the applicant has made an affidavit stating that he has not ceased to be an indigent person
since the date of the decree appealed from; but if the Government pleader or the respondent disputes the
truth of the statement made in such affidavit, an inquiry into the question aforesaid shall be held by the
Appellate Court or, under the orders of the Appellate Court, by an officer of that Court.
(2)Where the applicant, referred to in rule 11, is alleged to have become an indigent person since the
date of the decree appealed from, the inquiry into the question whether or not he is an indigent person
shall be made by the Appellate Court or, under the orders of the Appellate Court, by an officer of that
Court unless the Appellate Court considers it necessary in the circumstances of the case that the inquiry
should be held by the Court from whose decision the appeal is preferred.]
