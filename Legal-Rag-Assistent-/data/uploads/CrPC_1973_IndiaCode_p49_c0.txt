by the proclamation, the Court may, after making such inquiry as it thinks fit, pronounce him a proclaimed offender
and make a declaration to that effect.
(5) The provisions of sub-sections (2) and (3) shall apply to a declaration made by the Court under

83. Attachment of property of person absconding.—(1) The Court issuing a proclamation under
section 82 may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, at any time after the issue of the proclamation, order
the attachment of any property, movable or immovable, or both, belonging to the proclaimed person:
Provided that where at the time of the issue of the proclamation the Court is satisfied, by affidavit or
otherwise, that the person in relation to whom the proclamation is to be issued,—
(a) is about to dispose of the whole or any part of his property, or
(b) is about to remove the whole or any part of his property from the local jurisdiction of the
Court,
it may order the attachment simultaneously with the issue of the proclamation.
(2) Such order shall authorise the attachment of any property belonging to such person within the
district in which it is made; and it shall authorise the attachment of any property belonging to such person
without such district when endorsed by the District Magistrate within whose district such property is
situate.
(3) If the property ordered to be attached is a debt or other movable property, the attachment under
this section shall be made—
(a) by seizure; or
(b) by the appointment of a receiver; or
(c) by an order in writing prohibiting the delivery of such property to the proclaimed person or to
any one on his behalf; or
(d) by all or any two of such methods, as the Court thinks fit.
(4) If the property ordered to be attached is immovable, the attachment under this section shall, in the
case of land paying revenue to the State Government, be made through the Collector of the district in
which the land is situate, and in all other cases—
(a) by taking possession; or
(b) by the appointment of a receiver; or
(c) by an order in writing prohibiting the payment of rent on delivery of property to the
proclaimed person or to any one on his behalf; or
(d) by all or any two of such methods, as the Court thinks fit.
(5) If the property ordered to be attached consists of live-stock or is of a perishable nature, the Court
may, if it thinks it expedient, order immediate sale thereof, and in such case the proceeds of the sale shall
abide the order of the Court.
(6) The powers, duties and liabilities of a receiver appointed under this section shall be the same as
those of a receiver appointed under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908).
