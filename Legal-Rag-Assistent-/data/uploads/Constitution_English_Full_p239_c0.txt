THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA
(Part XVIII.—EMERGENCY PROVISIONS)
209
Provided that if any such Proclamation (not being a Proclamation
revoking a previous Proclamation) is issued at a time when the House of the
People has been dissolved, or the dissolution of the House of the People takes
place during the period of one month referred to in this clause, and if a
resolution approving the Proclamation has been passed by the Council of
States, but no resolution with respect to such Proclamation has been passed by
the House of the People before the expiration of that period, the Proclamation
shall cease to operate at the expiration of thirty days from the date on which the
House of the People first sits after its reconstitution, unless before the
expiration of the said period of thirty days a resolution approving the
Proclamation has been also passed by the House of the People.
(5) A Proclamation so approved shall, unless revoked, cease to operate
on the expiration of a period of six months from the date of the passing of the
second of the resolutions approving the Proclamation under clause (4):
Provided that if and so often as a resolution approving the continuance in
force of such a Proclamation is passed by both Houses of Parliament the
Proclamation shall, unless revoked, continue in force for a further period of six
months from the date on which it would otherwise have ceased to operate under
this clause:
Provided further that if the dissolution of the House of the People takes
place during any such period of six months and a resolution approving the
continuance in force of such Proclamation has been passed by the Council of
States but no resolution with respect to the continuance in force of such
Proclamation has been passed by the House of the People during the said
period, the Proclamation shall cease to operate at the expiration of thirty days
from the date on which the House of the People first sits after its reconstitution
unless before the expiration of the said period of thirty days, a resolution
approving the continuance in force of the Proclamation has been also passed
by the House of the People.
(6) For the purposes of clauses (4) and (5), a resolution may be passed
by either House of Parliament only by a majority of the total membership of
that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the Members of that
House present and voting.
(7) Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing clauses, the
President shall revoke a Proclamation issued under clause (1) or a Proclamation
varying such Proclamation if the House of the People passes a resolution
disapproving, or, as the case may be, disapproving the continuance in force of,
such Proclamation.
