twenty-one years of age is convicted of an offence punishable with fine only or with imprisonment for a term of
seven years or less, or when any person under twenty-one years of age or any woman is convicted of an offence not
punishable with death or imprisonment for life, and no previous conviction is proved against the offender, if it
appears to the Court before which he is convicted, regard being had to the age, character or antecedents of the
offender, and to the circumstances in which the offence was committed, that it is expedient that the offender should
be released on probation of good conduct, the Court may, instead of sentencing him at once to any punishment,
direct that he be released on his entering into a bond, with or without sureties, to appear and receive sentence when
called upon during such period (not exceeding three years) as the Court may direct, and in the meantime to keep the
peace and be of good behaviour:
Provided that where any first offender is convicted by a Magistrate of the second class not specially empowered
by the High Court, and the Magistrate is of opinion that the powers conferred by this section should be exercised, he
shall record his opinion to that effect, and submit the proceedings to a Magistrate of the first class, forwarding the
accused to, or taking bail for his appearance before, such Magistrate, who shall dispose of the case in the manner
provided by sub-section (2).
(2) Where proceedings are submitted to a Magistrate of the first class as provided by sub-section (1), such Magistrate
may thereupon pass such sentence or make such order as he might have passed or made if the case had originally been
heard by him, and, if he thinks further inquiry or additional evidence on any point to be necessary, he may make such
inquiry or take such evidence himself or direct such inquiry or evidence to be made or taken.
(3) In any case in which a person is convicted of theft, theft in a building, dishonest misappropriation, cheating
or any offence under the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), punishable with not more than two years, imprisonment or
any offence punishable with fine only and no previous conviction is proved against him, the Court before which he
is so convicted may, if it thinks fit, having regard to the age, character, antecedents or physical or mental condition
of the offender and to the trivial nature of the offence or any extenuating circumstances under which the offence was
committed, instead of sentencing him to any punishment, release him after due admonition.
(4) An order under this section may be made by any Appellate Court or by the High Court or Court of Session
when exercising its powers of revision.
(5) When an order has been made under this section in respect of any offender, the High Court or Court of
Session may, on appeal when there is a right of appeal to such Court, or when exercising its powers of revision, set
aside such order, and in lieu thereof pass sentence on such offender according to law:
Provided that the High Court or Court of Session shall not under this sub-section inflict a greater punishment
than might have been inflicted by the Court by which the offender was convicted.
(6) The provisions of sections 121, 124 and 373 shall, so far as may be, apply in the case of sureties offered in
pursuance of the provisions of this section.
(7) The Court, before directing the release of an offender under sub-section (1), shall be satisfied that an
offender or his surety (if any) has a fixed place of abode or regular occupation in the place for which the Court acts
or in which the offender is likely to live during the period named for the observance of the conditions.
(8) If the Court which convicted the offender, or a Court which could have dealt with the offender in respect of
his original offence, is satisfied that the offender has failed to observe any of the conditions of his recognizance, it
may issue a warrant for his apprehension.
(9) An offender, when apprehended on any such warrant, shall be brought forthwith before the Court issuing the
warrant, and such Court may either remand him in custody until the case is heard or admit him to bail with a
sufficient surety conditioned on his appearing for sentence and such Court may, after hearing the case, pass
sentence.
(10) Nothing in this section shall affect the provisions of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 (20 of 1958), or
the Children Act, 1960 (60 of 1960) or any other law for the time being in force for the treatment, training or
rehabilitation of youthful offenders.
