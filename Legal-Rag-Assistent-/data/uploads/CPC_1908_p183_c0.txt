19. Re-admission of appeal dismissed for default.—Where an appeal is dismissed under rule 11,
sub-rule (2) or rule 17 3*** the appellant may apply to the Appellate Court for the re-admission of the
appeal; and, where it is proved that he was prevented by any sufficient cause from appearing when the
appeal was, called on for hearing or from depositing the sum so required, the Court shall re-admit the
appeal on such terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks fit.
20. Power to adjourn hearing and direct persons appearing interested to be made respondents.—
4[(1)] Where it appears to the Court at the hearing that any person who was a party to the suit in the Court from
whose decree the appeal is preferred, but who has not been made a party to the appeal, is interested in the
result of the appeal, the Court may adjourn the hearing to a future day to be fixed by the Court and direct that
such person be made a respondent.
5[(2) No respondent shall be added under this rule, after the expiry of the period of limitation for
appeal. unless the Court, for reasons to be recorded, allows that to be done, on such terms as to costs as it
thinks fit.]
21. Re-hearing on application of respondent against whom ex parte decree made.—Where an
appeal is heard ex parte and judgment is pronounced against the respondent, he may apply to the
Appellate Court to re-hear the appeal: and, if he satisfies the Court that the notice was not duly served or
that he was prevented by sufficient cause from appearing when the appeal was called on for hearing, the
Court shall re-hear the appeal on such terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks fit to impose upon him.
22. Upon hearing respondent may object to decree as if he had preferred separate appeal.—(1)
Any respondent, though he may not have appealed from any part of the decree, may not only support the
decree 6[but may also state that the finding against him in the Court below in respect of any issue ought to
have been in his favour; and may also take any cross-objection] to the decree which he could have taken
by way of appeal provided he has filed such objection in the Appellate Court within one month from the
date of service on him or his pleader of notice of the day fixed for hearing the appeal, or within such
further time as the Appellate Court may see fit to allow.
1[Explanation. —A respondent aggrieved by a finding of the Court in the judgment on which the
decree appealed against is based may, under this rule, file cross-objection in respect of the decree in so far
as it is based on that finding, notwithstanding that by reason of the decision of the Court on any other
finding which is sufficient for the decision of the suit, the decree, is, wholly or in part, in favour of that
respondent.]
(2) Form of objection and provisions applicable thereto.—Such cross-objection shall be in the
form of a memorandum, and the provisions of rule 1, so far as they relate to the form and contents of the
memorandum of appeal, shall apply thereto.
