THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA
(Part VI.—The States)
98
(a) shall be laid before the Legislative Assembly of the State, or
where there is a Legislative Council in the State, before both the Houses,
and shall cease to operate at the expiration of six weeks from the
reassembly of the Legislature, or if before the expiration of that period a
resolution disapproving it is passed by the Legislative Assembly and
agreed to by the Legislative Council, if any, upon the passing of the
resolution or, as the case may be, on the resolution being agreed to by
the Council; and
(b) may be withdrawn at any time by the Governor.
Explanation.—Where the Houses of the Legislature of a State having a
Legislative Council are summoned to reassemble on different dates, the period
of six weeks shall be reckoned from the later of those dates for the purposes of
this clause.
(3) If and so far as an Ordinance under this article makes any provision
which would not be valid if enacted in an Act of the Legislature of the State
assented to by the Governor, it shall be void:
Provided that, for the purposes of the provisions of this Constitution
relating to the effect of an Act of the Legislature of a State which is repugnant
to an Act of Parliament or an existing law with respect to a matter enumerated
in the Concurrent List, an Ordinance promulgated under this article in
pursuance of instructions from the President shall be deemed to be an Act of
the Legislature of the State which has been reserved for the consideration of the
President and assented to by him.
