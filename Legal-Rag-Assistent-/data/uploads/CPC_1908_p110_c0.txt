Court, but all the parties to the suit who appear in person, and the pleaders of such of the parties as appear
by pleaders, do not object to having such evidence as is given in English, being taken down in English,
the judge may so take it down or cause it to be taken down.
(2) Where evidence is not given in English but all the parties who appear in person, and the pleaders of
such of the parties as appear by pleaders, do not object to having such evidence being taken down in English,
the Judge may take down, or cause to be taken down, such evidence in English.]

respecting the demeanour of any witness while under examination.
