(iv) that, if the money realised by such sale shall not be sufficient for payment in full of the amounts
due to defendant No. 2 and the plaintiff, defendant No. 2 or the plaintiff or both of them, as the case may
be, shall be at liberty (when such remedy is open under the terms of their respective mortgages and is not
barred by any law for the time being in force) to apply for a personal decree against defendant No. 1 for
the amounts remaining due to them respectively.
5. And it is hereby further ordered and decreed,—
(a) that, if the plaintiff pays into Court to the credit of this suit the amount adjudged due to
defendant No. 2 but defendant No. 1 makes default in the payment of the said amount, the plaintiff shall
be at liberty to apply to the Court to keep defendant No. 2's mortgage alive for his benefit and to apply
for final decree (in the same manner as the defendant No. 2 might have done under clause 4 above)—
1[(i) that defendant No. 1 shall thenceforth stand absolutely debarred and foreclosed of and
from all right to redeem the mortgaged property described in the Schedule annexed hereto and
shall, if so required, deliver up to the plaintiff quiet and peaceable possession of the said
property]; or
1[(ii) that the mortgaged property or a sufficient part thereof be sold and that for the purposes
of such sale the plaintiff shall produce before the Court or such officer as it appoints, all
documents in his possession or power relating to the mortgaged property;] and
(b) (if on the application of defendant No. 2 such a final decree for foreclosure is passed), that the
whole of the liability of defendant No. 1 arising from the plaintiff’s mortgage or from the mortgage of
defendant No. 2 or from this suit shall be deemed to have been discharged and extinguished.
6. And it is hereby further ordered and decreed (in the case where a sale is ordered under clause 5
above)—
(i) that the money realised by such sale shall be paid into Court and be duly applied (after
deduction therefrom of the expenses of the sale) first in payment of the amount paid by the plaintiff in
respect of defendant No. 2's mortgage and the cost of the suit in connection therewith and in payment
of the amount which the Court may adjudge due in respect of subsequent interest on the said amount;
and that the balance, if any, shall then be applied in payment of the amount adjudged due to the
plaintiff in respect of his own mortgage under this decree and any further orders that may be passed
and in payment of the amount which the Court may adjudge due in respect of such costs of the suit
and such costs, charges and expenses as may by payable to the plaintiff under rule 10, together with
such subsequent interest as may be payable under rule 11, of Order XXXIV of the First Schedule to
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, and that the balance, if any, shall be paid to defendant No. 1 or
other persons entitled to receive the same; and
(ii) that, if the money realised by such sale shall not be sufficient for payment in full of the
amount due in respect of defendant No. 2's mortgage or the plaintiff's mortgage, defendant No. 2 shall
be at liberty (where such remedy is open to him under the terms of his mortgage and is not barred by
any law for the time being in force) to apply for a personal decree against defendant No. 1 for the
amount of the balance.
7. And it is hereby further ordered and decreed that the parties are at liberty to apply to the Court
from time to time as they may have occasion, and on such application or otherwise the Court may give
such directions as it thinks fit.
