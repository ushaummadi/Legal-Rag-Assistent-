142. When they must not be asked. –– Leading questions must not, if objected to by the adverse
party, be asked in an examination-in-chief, or in a re-examination, except with the permission of the
Court.
The Court shall permit leading questions as to matters which are introductory or undisputed, or which
have, in its opinion, been already sufficiently proved.
143. When they may be asked. –– Leading questions may be asked in cross-examination.
144. Evidence as to matters in writing. –– Any witness may be asked, whilst under examination,
whether any contract, grant or other disposition of property, as to which he is giving evidence, was not
contained in a document, and if he says that it was, or if he is about to make any statement as to the
contents of any document, which, in the opinion of the Court, ought to be produced, the adverse party
may object to such evidence being given until such document is produced, or until facts have been proved
which entitle the party who called the witness to give secondary evidence of it.
Explanation. –– A witness may give oral evidence of statements made by other persons about the
contents of documents if such statements are in themselves relevant facts.
Illustration
The question is, whether A assaulted B.
C deposes that he heard A say to D–– “B wrote a letter accusing me of theft, and I will be revenged
on him.” This statement is relevant, as showing A’s motive for the assault, and evidence may be given of
it, though no other evidence is given about the letter.
1145. Cross-examination as to previous statements in writing. –– A witness may be cross-
examined as to previous statements made by him in writing or reduced into writing, and relevant to
matters in question, without such writing being shown to him, or being proved; but, if it is intended to
contradict him by the writing, his attention must, before the writing can be proved, be called to those parts
of it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him.
146. Questions lawful in cross-examination. –– When a witness is cross-examined, he may, in
addition to the questions hereinbefore referred to, be asked any questions which tend––
(1) to test his veracity,
(2) to discover who he is and what is his position in life, or
(3) to shake his credit, by injuring his character, although the answer to such questions might tend
directly or indirectly to criminate him, or might expose or tend directly or indirectly to expose him to
a penalty or forfeiture:

Penal Code (45 of 1860) or for attempt to commit any such offence, where the question of consent is an
issue, it shall not be permissible to adduce evidence or to put questions in the cross-examination of the
victim as to the general immoral character, or previous sexual experience, of such victim with any person
for proving such consent or the quality of consent.]
