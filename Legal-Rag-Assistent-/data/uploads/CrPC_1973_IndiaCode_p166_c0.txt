(a) no appeal presented under section 382 shall be dismissed unless the appellant or his pleader has had a
reasonable opportunity of being heard in support of the same;
(b) no appeal presented under section 383 shall be dismissed except after giving the appellant a reasonable
opportunity of being heard in support of the same, unless the Appellate Court considers that the appeal is
frivolous or that the production of the accused in custody before the Court would involve such inconvenience as
would be disproportionate in the circumstances of the case;
(c) no appeal presented under section 383 shall be dismissed summarily until the period allowed for
preferring such appeal has expired.
(2) Before dismissing an appeal under this section, the Court may call for the record of the case.
(3) Where the Appellate Court dismissing an appeal under this section is a Court of Session or of the Chief
Judicial Magistrate, it shall record its reasons for doing so.
(4) Where an appeal presented under section 383 has been dismissed summarily under this section and the
Appellate Court finds that another petition of appeal duly presented under section 382 on behalf of the same
appellant has not been considered by it, that Court may, notwithstanding anything contained in section 393, if
satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of justice so to do, hear and dispose of such appeal in accordance with
law.
385. Procedure for hearing appeals not dismissed summarily.—(1) If the Appellate Court does not dismiss
the appeal summarily, it shall cause notice of the time and place at which such appeal will be heard to be given—
(i) to the appellant or his pleader;
(ii) to such officer as the State Government may appoint in this behalf;
(iii) if the appeal is from a judgment of conviction in a case instituted upon complaint, to the complainant;
(iv) if the appeal is under section 377 or section 378, to the accused, and shall also furnish such officer,
complainant and accused with a copy of the grounds of appeal.
(2) The Appellate Court shall then send for the record of the case, if such record is not already available in that
Court, and hear the parties:
Provided that if the appeal is only as to the extent or the legality of the sentence, the Court may dispose of the
appeal without sending for the record.
(3) Where the only ground for appeal from a conviction is the alleged severity of the sentence, the appellant
shall not, except with the leave of the Court, urge or be heard in support of any other ground.
386. Powers of the Appellate Court.—After perusing such record and hearing the appellant or his pleader, if
he appears, and the Public Prosecutor if he appears, and in case of an appeal under section 377 or section 378, the
accused, if he appears, the Appellate Court may, if it considers that there is no sufficient ground for interfering,
dismiss the appeal, or may—
(a) in an appeal from an order or acquittal, reverse such order and direct that further inquiry be made, or
that the accused be re-tried or committed for trial, as the case may be, or find him guilty and pass sentence on
him according to law;
(b) in an appeal from a conviction—
(i) reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or discharge the accused, or order him to be re-tried by a
Court of competent jurisdiction subordinate to such Appellate Court or committed for trial, or
(ii) alter the finding, maintaining the sentence, or
