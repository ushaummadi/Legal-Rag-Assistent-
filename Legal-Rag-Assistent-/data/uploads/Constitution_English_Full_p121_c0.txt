Legislative Assembly signed by him that it is a Money Bill.
200. Assent to Bills.—When a Bill has been passed by the Legislative
Assembly of a State or, in the case of a State having a Legislative Council, has
been passed by both Houses of the Legislature of the State, it shall be presented
to the Governor and the Governor shall declare either that he assents to the Bill
or that he withholds assent therefrom or that he reserves the Bill for the
consideration of the President:
Provided that the Governor may, as soon as possible after the
presentation to him of the Bill for assent, return the Bill if it is not a Money Bill
together with a message requesting that the House or Houses will reconsider
the Bill or any specified provisions thereof and, in particular, will consider the
desirability of introducing any such amendments as he may recommend in his
message and, when a Bill is so returned, the House or Houses shall reconsider
the Bill accordingly, and if the Bill is passed again by the House or Houses
with or without amendment and presented to the Governor for assent, the
Governor shall not withhold assent therefrom:
Provided further that the Governor shall not assent to, but shall reserve
for the consideration of the President, any Bill which in the opinion of the
Governor would, if it became law, so derogate from the powers of the High
Court as to endanger the position which that Court is by this Constitution
designed to fill.

Governor for the consideration of the President, the President shall declare
either that he assents to the Bill or that he withholds assent therefrom:

direct the Governor to return the Bill to the House or, as the case may be, the
Houses of the Legislature of the State together with such a message as is
mentioned in the first proviso to article 200 and, when a Bill is so returned, the
House or Houses shall reconsider it accordingly within a period of six months
