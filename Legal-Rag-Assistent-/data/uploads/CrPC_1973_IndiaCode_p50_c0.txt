84. Claims and objections to attachment.—(1) If any claim is preferred to, or objection made to the
attachment of, any property attached under section 83, within six months from the date of such
attachment, by any person other than the proclaimed person, on the ground that the claimant or objector
has an interest in such property, and that such interest is not liable to attachment under section 83, the
claim or objection shall be inquired into, and may be allowed or disallowed in whole or in part:
Provided that any claim preferred or objection made within the period allowed by this sub-section
may, in the event of the death of the claimant or objector, be continued by his legal representative.
(2) Claims or objections under sub-section (1) may be preferred or made in the Court by which the
order of attachment is issued, or, if the claim or objection is in respect of property attached under an order
endorsed under sub-section (2) of section 83, in the Court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate of the district
in which the attachment is made.
(3) Every such claim or objection shall be inquired into by the Court in which it is preferred or made:
Provided that, if it is preferred or made in the Court of a Chief Judicial Magistrate, he may make it
over for disposal to any Magistrate subordinate to him.
(4) Any person whose claim or objection has been disallowed in whole or in part by an order under
sub-section (1) may, within a period of one year from the date of such order, institute a suit to establish
the right which he claims in respect of the property in dispute; but subject to the result of such suit, if any,
the order shall be conclusive.
85. Release, sale and restoration of attached property.—(1) If the proclaimed person appears
within the time specified in the proclamation, the Court shall make an order releasing the property from
the attachment.
(2) If the proclaimed person does not appear within the time specified in the proclamation, the
property under the attachment shall be at the disposal of the State Government; but it shall not be sold
until the expiration of six months from the date of the attachment and until any claim preferred or
objection made under section 84 has been disposed of under that section, unless it is subject to speedy and
natural decay, or the Court considers that the sale would be for the benefit of the owner; in either of which
cases the Court may cause it to be sold whenever it thinks fit.
(3) If, within two years from the date of the attachment, any person whose property is or has been at
the disposal of the State Government, under sub-section (2), appears voluntarily or is apprehended and
brought before the Court by whose order the property was attached, or the Court to which such Court is
subordinate, and proves to the satisfaction of such Court that he did not abscond or conceal himself for
the purpose of avoiding execution of the warrant, and that he had not such notice of the proclamation as to
enable him to attend within the time specified therein, such property, or, if the same has been sold, the
net proceeds of the sale, or, if part only thereof has been sold, the net proceeds of the sale and the residue
of the property, shall, after satisfying therefrom all costs incurred in consequence of the attachment, be
delivered to him.
86. Appeal from order rejecting application for restoration of attached property.—Any person
referred to in sub-section (3) of section 85, who is aggrieved by any refusal to deliver property or the
proceeds of the sale thereof may appeal to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the sentences of
the first-mentioned Court.

87. Issue of warrant in lieu of, or in addition to, summons.—A Court may, in any case in which it
is empowered by this Code to issue a summons for the appearance of any person, issue, after recording its
reasons in writing, a warrant for his arrest—
(a) if, either before the issue of such summons, or after the issue of the same but before the time
fixed for his appearance, the Court sees reason to believe that he has absconded or will not obey the
summons; or
