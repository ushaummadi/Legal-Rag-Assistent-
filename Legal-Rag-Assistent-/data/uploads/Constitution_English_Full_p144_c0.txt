respect to any matter is repugnant to any provision of a law made by Parliament
with respect to that matter, whether passed before or after the law made by the
Legislative Assembly, or of an earlier law, other than a law made by the
Legislative Assembly, then, in either case, the law made by Parliament, or, as
the case may be, such earlier law, shall prevail and the law made by the
Legislative Assembly shall, to the extent of the repugnancy, be void:
Provided that if any such law made by the Legislative Assembly has
been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent,

under any law, required to act in his discretion:
Provided that in the case of difference of opinion between the Lieutenant
Governor and his Ministers on any matter, the Lieutenant Governor shall refer
it to the President for decision and act according to the decision given thereon
by the President and pending such decision it shall be competent for the

that it is necessary for him to take immediate action, to take such action or to
give such direction in the matter as he deems necessary.
