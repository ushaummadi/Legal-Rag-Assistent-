(2) Such inquiry shall be made, as nearly as may be practicable, in the manner hereinafter prescribed for
conducting trial and recording evidence in summons-cases.
(3) After the commencement, and before the completion, of the inquiry under sub-section (1), the Magistrate,
if he considers that immediate measures are necessary for the prevention of a breach of the peace or disturbance
of the public tranquillity or the commission of any offence or for the public safety, may, for reasons to be
recorded in writing, direct the person in respect of whom the order under section 111 has been made to execute a
bond, with or without sureties, for keeping the peace or maintaining good behaviour until the conclusion of the
inquiry, and may detain him in custody until such bond is executed or, in default of execution, until the inquiry is
concluded:
Provided that—
(a) no person against whom proceedings are not being taken under section 108, section 109, or section 110
shall be directed to execute a bond for maintaining good behaviour;
(b) the conditions of such bond, whether as to the amount thereof or as to the provision of sureties or the
number thereof or the pecuniary extent of their liability, shall not be more onerous than those specified in the
order under section 111.
(4) For the purposes of this section the fact that a person is an habitual offender or is so desperate and dangerous
as to render his being at large without security hazardous to the community may be proved by evidence of general
repute or otherwise.
(5) Where two or more persons have been associated together in the matter under inquiry, they may be dealt
within the same or separate inquiries as the Magistrate shall think just.
(6) The inquiry under this section shall be completed within a period of six months from the date of its
commencement, and if such inquiry is not so completed, the proceedings under this Chapter shall, on the expiry of
the said period, stand terminated unless, for special reasons to be recorded in writing, the Magistrate otherwise
directs:
Provided that where any person has been kept in detention pending such inquiry, the proceeding against that
person, unless terminated earlier, shall stand terminated on the expiry of a period of six months of such detention.
(7) Where any direction is made under sub-section (6) permitting the continuance of proceedings the Sessions
Judge may, on an application made to him by the aggrieved party, vacate such direction if he is satisfied that it was
not based on any special reason or was perverse.
117. Order to give security.—If, upon such inquiry, it is proved that it is necessary for keeping the peace or
maintaining good behaviour, as the case may be, that the person in respect of whom the inquiry is made should
execute a bond, with or without sureties, the Magistrate shall make an order accordingly:
Provided that—
(a) no person shall be ordered to give security of a nature different from, or of an amount larger than, or for
a period longer than, that specified in the order made under section 111;
(b) the amount of every bond shall be fixed with due regard to the circumstances of the case and shall not
be excessive;
(c) when the person in respect of whom the inquiry is made is a minor, the bond shall be executed only by
his sureties.
118. Discharge of person informed against.—If, on an inquiry under section 116, it is not proved that it is
necessary for keeping the peace or maintaining good behaviour, as the case may be, that the person in respect of
whom the inquiry is made, should execute a bond, the Magistrate shall make an entry on the record to that effect,
and if such person is in custody only for the purposes of the inquiry, shall release him, or, if such person is not in
custody, shall discharge him.
