11. Procedure where indigent person fails.—Where the plaintiff fails in the suit or the permission
granted to him to sue as an indigent person has been withdrawn, or where the suit is withdrawn or
dismissed,—
(a) because the summons for the defendant to appear and answer has not been served upon him in
consequence of the failure of the plaintiff to pay the court-fee or postal charges (if any) chargeable for
such service 1[or to present copies of the plaint or concise statement], or
(b) because the plaintiff does not appear when the suit is called on for hearing,
the Court shall order the plaintiff, or any person added as a co-plaintiff to the suit, to pay the court-fees
which would have been paid by the plaintiff if he had not been permitted to sue as an 2[indigent person].
3[11A. Procedure where indigent person suit abates.—Where the suit abates by reason of the death
of the plaintiff or of any person added as a co-plaintiff, the Court shall order that the amount of court-fees
which would have been paid by the plaintiff if he had not been permitted to sue as an
2[indigent person] shall be recoverable by the State Government from the estate of the deceased plaintiff.]
12. State Government may apply for payment of court-fees.— The 4[State Government] shall have
the right at any time to apply to the Court to make an order for the payment of court-fees under rule 10,
5[rule 11 or rule 11A].
13. State Government to be deemed a party.—All matters arising between the 4[State Government]
and any party to the suit under rule 10, rule 11,5[rule 11A] or rule 12 shall be deemed to be questions
arising between the parties to the suit within the meaning of section 47.
6[14. Recovery of amount of court-fees.—Where an order is made under rule 10, rule 11 or rule
11A, the court shall forthwith cause a copy of the decree or order to be forwarded to the Collector who
may, without prejudice to any other mode of recovery, recover the amount of court-fees specified therein
from the person or property liable for the payment as if it were an arrear or land revenue.]
15. Refusal to allow applicant to sue as an indigent person to bar subsequent application of like
nature.—An order refusing to allow the applicant to sue as an 2[indigent person] shall be a bar to any
subsequent application of the like nature by him in respect of the same right to sue; but the applicant shall
be at liberty to institute a suit in the ordinary manner in respect of such right; 7[provided that the plaint
shall be rejected if he does not pay, either at the time of the institution of the suit or within such time
thereafter as the Court may allow,] the costs (if any) incurred by the 4[State Government] and by the
opposite party in opposing his application for leave to sue as an 2[indigent person].
1[15A. Grant of time for payment of court-fee.—Nothing contained in rule 5, rule 7 or rule 15 shall
prevent a Court, while rejecting an application under rule 5 or refusing an application under rule 7, from
granting time to the applicant to pay the requisite court-fee within such time as may be fixed by the Court
or extended by it from time to time; and upon such payment and on payment of the costs referred to in
8*** rule 15 within that time, the suit shall be deemed to have been instituted on the date on which the
application for permission to sue as an indigent person was presented. ]
