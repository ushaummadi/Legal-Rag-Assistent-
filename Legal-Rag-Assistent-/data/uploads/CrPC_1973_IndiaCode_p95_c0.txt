186. High Court to decide, in case of doubt, district where inquiry or trial shall take place.—Where two or
more Courts have taken cognizance of the same offence and a question arises as to which of them ought to inquire
into or try that offence, the question shall be decided—
(a) if the Courts are subordinate to the same High Court, by that High Court;
(b) if the Courts are not subordinate to the same High Court, by the High Court within the local limits of
whose appellate criminal jurisdiction the proceedings were first commenced,
and thereupon all other proceedings in respect of that offence shall be discontinued.
187. Power to issue summons or warrant for offence committed beyond local jurisdiction.—(1) When a
Magistrate of the first class sees reason to believe that any person within his local jurisdiction has committed outside
such jurisdiction (whether within or outside India) an offence which cannot, under the provisions of sections 177 to
185 (both inclusive), or any other law for the time being in force, be inquired into or tried within such jurisdiction
but is under some law for the time being in force triable in India, such Magistrate may inquire into the offence as if
it had been committed within such local jurisdiction and compel such person in the manner hereinbefore provided to
appear before him, and send such person to the Magistrate having jurisdiction to inquire into or try such offence, or,
if such offence is not punishable with death or imprisonment for life and such person is ready and willing to give
bail to the satisfaction of the Magistrate acting under this section, take a bond with or without sureties for his
appearance before the Magistrate having such jurisdiction.
(2) When there are more Magistrates than one having such jurisdiction and the Magistrate acting under this
section cannot satisfy himself as to the Magistrate to or before whom such person should be sent or bound to appear,
the case shall be reported for the orders of the High Court.
188. Offence committed outside India.—When an offence is committed outside India—
(a) by a citizen of India, whether on the high seas or elsewhere; or
(b) by a person, not being such citizen, on any ship or aircraft registered in India,
he may be dealt with in respect of such offence as if it had been committed at any place within India at which he
may be found:
Provided that, notwithstanding anything in any of the preceding sections of this Chapter, no such offence shall
be inquired into or tried in India except with the previous sanction of the Central Government.
189. Receipt of evidence relating to offences committed outside India.—When any offence alleged to have
been committed in a territory outside India is being inquired into or tried under the provisions of section 188, the
Central Government may, if it thinks fit, direct that copies of depositions made or exhibits produced before a
Judicial officer in or for that territory or before a diplomatic or consular representative of India in or for that territory
shall be received as evidence by the Court holding such inquiry or trial in any case in which such Court might issue
a commission for taking evidence as to the matters to which such depositions or exhibits relate.
