THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA
(Part V.—The Union)
49
the President may, unless the Bill has elapsed by reason of a dissolution of the
House of the People, notify to the Houses by message if they are sitting or by
public notification if they are not sitting, his intention to summon them to meet
in a joint sitting for the purpose of deliberating and voting on the Bill:
Provided that nothing in this clause shall apply to a Money Bill.
(2) In reckoning any such period of six months as is referred to in
clause (1), no account shall be taken of any period during which the House
referred to in sub-clause (c) of that clause is prorogued or adjourned for more
than four consecutive days.
(3) Where the President has under clause (1) notified his intention of
summoning the Houses to meet in a joint sitting, neither House shall proceed
further with the Bill, but the President may at any time after the date of his
notification summon the Houses to meet in a joint sitting for the purpose specified
in the notification and, if he does so, the Houses shall meet accordingly.
(4) If at the joint sitting of the two Houses the Bill, with such amendments,
if any, as are agreed to in joint sitting, is passed by a majority of the total number
of members of both Houses present and voting, it shall be deemed for the
purposes of this Constitution to have been passed by both Houses:
Provided that at a joint sitting—
(a) if the Bill, having been passed by one House, has not been passed
by the other House with amendments and returned to the House in which
it originated, no amendment shall be proposed to the Bill other than such
amendments (if any) as are made necessary by the delay in the passage
of the Bill;
(b) if the Bill has been so passed and returned, only such amendments as
aforesaid shall be proposed to the Bill and such other amendments as are
relevant to the matters with respect to which the Houses have not agreed,
and the decision of the person presiding as to the amendments which are admissible
under this clause shall be final.
(5) A joint sitting may be held under this article and a Bill passed
thereat, notwithstanding that a dissolution of the House of the People has
intervened since the President notified his intention to summon the Houses to
meet therein.
109. Special procedure in respect of Money Bills.—(1) A Money Bill
shall not be introduced in the Council of States.
