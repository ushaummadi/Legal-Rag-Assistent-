information was received by the Magistrate, or after that date and before the date of his order under
sub-section (1), he may treat the party so dispossessed as if that party had been in possession on the
date of his order under sub-section (1).
(5) Nothing in this section shall preclude any party so required to attend, or any other person
interested, from showing that no such dispute as aforesaid exists or has existed; and in such case the
Magistrate shall cancel his said order, and all further proceedings thereon shall be stayed, but, subject
to such cancellation, the order of the Magistrate under sub-section (1) shall be final.
(6) (a) If the Magistrate decides that one of the parties was, or should under the proviso to sub-
section (4) be treated as being, in such possession of the said subject, he shall issue an order
declaring such party to be entitled to possession thereof until evicted therefrom in due course of law,
and forbidding all disturbance of such possession until such eviction; and when he proceeds under
the proviso to sub-section (4), may restore to possession the party forcibly and wrongfully
dispossessed.
(b) The order made under this sub-section shall be served and published in the manner laid down
in sub-section (3).
(7) When any party to any such proceeding dies, the Magistrate may cause the legal
representative of the deceased party to be made a party to the proceeding and shall thereupon
continue the inquiry, and if any question arises as to who the legal representative of a deceased party
for the purposes of such proceeding is, all persons claiming to be representatives of the deceased
party shall be made parties thereto.
(8) If the Magistrate is of opinion that any crop or other produce of the property, the subject of dispute in a
proceeding under this section pending before him, is subject to speedy and natural decay, he may make an
order for the proper custody or sale of such property, and, upon the completion of the inquiry, shall make such
order for the disposal of such property, or the sale-proceeds thereof, as he thinks fit.
(9) The Magistrate may, if he thinks fit, at any stage of the proceedings under this section, on the
application of either party, issue a summons to any witness directing him to attend or to produce any
document or thing.
(10) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to be in derogation of powers of the Magistrate to

after making the order under sub-section (1) of section 145 considers the case to be one of emergency, or
if he decides that none of the parties was then in such possession as is referred to in section 145, or if he is
unable to satisfy himself as to which of them was then in such possession of the subject of dispute, he
may attach the subject of dispute until a competent Court has determined the rights of the parties thereto
with regard to the person entitled to the possession thereof:
Provided that such Magistrate may withdraw the attachment at any time if he is satisfied that there is
no longer any likelihood of breach of the peace with regard to the subject of dispute.
(2) When the Magistrate attaches the subject of dispute, he may, if no receiver in relation to such
subject of dispute has been appointed by any Civil Court, make such arrangements as he considers proper
for looking after the property or if he thinks fit, appoint a receiver thereof, who shall have, subject to the
control of the Magistrate, all the powers of a receiver appointed under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
