FORM No. 25
MAGISTRATE’S ORDER DECLARING PARTY ENTITLED TO RETAIN POSSESSION OF LAND, ETC., IN DISPUTE
(See section 145)
It appears to me, on the grounds duly recorded, that a dispute, likely to induce a breach of the peace,
existed between (describe the parties by name and residence or residence only if
the dispute be between bodies of villagers) concerning certain (state concisely the
subject of dispute), situate within my local jurisdiction, all the said parties were called upon to give in a
written statement of their respective claims as to the fact of actual possession of the said (the
subject of dispute), and being satisfied by due inquiry had thereupon, without reference to the merits of
the claim of either of the said parties to the legal right of possession, that the claim of actual possession by
the said (name or names or description) is true; I do decide and declare that
he is (or they are) in possession of the said (the subject of dispute) and
entitled to retain such possession until ousted by due course of law, and do strictly forbid any disturbance
of his (or their) possession in the meantime.
