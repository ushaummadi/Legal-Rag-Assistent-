ORDER XX
Judgment and decree
1[ 21. Judgment when pronounced.—3[(1) The Court, after the case has been heard, shall pronounce
judgment in an open Court, either at once, or as soon thereafter as may be practicable and when the
judgment is to be pronounced on some future day, the Court shall fix a day for that purpose, of which due
notice shall be given to the parties or their pleaders:]
4[Provided that where the judgment is not pronounced at once, every endeavour shall be made by the
Court to pronounce the judgment within thirty days from the date on which the hearing of the case was
concluded but, where it is not practicable so to do on the ground of the exceptional and extraordinary
circumstances of the case, the Court shall fix a future day for the pronouncement of the judgment, and
such day shall not ordinarily be a day beyond sixty days from the date on which the hearing of the case
was concluded, and due notice of the day so fixed shall be given to the parties or their pleaders.]
Provided further that, where a judgment is not pronounced within thirty days from the date on which
the hearing of the case was concluded, the Court shall record the reasons for such delay and shall fix a
future day on which the judgment will be pronounced and due notice of the day so fixed shall be given to
the parties or their pleaders.]
5[(2) Where a written judgment is to be pronounced, it shall be sufficient if the findings of the Court
on each issue and the final order passed in the case are read out and it shall not be necessary for the Court
to read out the whole judgment 6***.
(3) The judgment may be pronounced by dictation in open Court to a shorthand writer if the Judge is
specially empowered by the High Court in this behalf:
Provided that, where the judgment is pronounced by dictation in open Court, the transcript of the
judgment so pronounced shall, after making such correction therein as may be necessary, be signed by the
judge, bear the date on which it was pronounced, and form a part of the record.]
6. Contents of decree.—(1) The decree shall agree with the judgment: it shall contain the number of
the suit, the 7[names and descriptions of the parties, their registered addresses,] and particulars of the
claim, and shall specify clearly the relief granted or other determination of the suit.
(2)The decree shall also state the amount of costs incurred in the suit, and by whom or out of what
property and in what proportions such costs are to be paid.
(3) The Court may direct that the costs payable to one party by the other shall be set off against any
sum which is admitted or found to be due from the former to the latter.
8[6A. Preparation of decree.—(1) Every endeavour shall be made to ensure that the decree is drawn
up as expeditiously as possible and, in any case, within fifteen days from the date on which the judgment
is pronounced.
(2) An appeal may be preferred against the decree without filing a copy of the decree and in such a
case the copy made available to the party by the court shall for the purposes of rule 1 of Order XLI be
treated as the decree. But as soon as the decree is drawn, the judgment shall cease to have the effect of a
decree for the purposes of execution or for any other purpose.
6B. Copies of judgments when to be made available.—Where the judgment is pronounced, copies of
the judgment shall be made available to the parties immediately after the pronouncement of the judgment
for preferring an appeal on payment of such charges as may be specified in the rule made by the High
Court.]
