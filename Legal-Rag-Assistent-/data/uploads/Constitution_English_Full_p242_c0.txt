Constitution relating to High Courts.
(2) Any such Proclamation may be revoked or varied by a subsequent

the expiration of that period it has been approved by resolutions of both Houses
of Parliament:
Provided that if any such Proclamation (not being a Proclamation
revoking a previous Proclamation) is issued at a time when the House of the
People is dissolved or the dissolution of the House of the People takes place
during the period of two months referred to in this clause, and if a resolution
approving the Proclamation has been passed by the Council of States, but no
resolution with respect to such Proclamation has been passed by the House of
the People before the expiration of that period, the Proclamation shall cease to
operate at the expiration of thirty days from the date on which the House of the
People first sits after its reconstitution unless before the expiration of the said
