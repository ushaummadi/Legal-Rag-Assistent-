APPEALS FROM ORIGINAL DECREES
96. Appeal from original decree.—(1)Save where otherwise expressly provided in the body of this

Court.
(2) An appeal may lie from an original decree passed ex parte.
(3) No appeal shall lie from a decree passed by the Court with the consent of parties.
1[(4) No appeal shall lie, except on a question of law, from a decree in any suit of the nature
cognizable by Courts of Small Causes, when the amount or value of the subject-matter of the original suit
does not exceed 2[ten thousand rupees.]]
97. Appeal from final decree where no appeal from preliminary decree.—Where any party
aggrieved by a preliminary decree passed after the commencement of this Code does not appeal from such
decree, he shall be precluded from disputing its correctness in any appeal which may be preferred from
the final decree.
98. Decision where appeal heard by two or more Judges.—(1) Where an appeal is heard by a Bench
of two or more Judges, the appeal shall be decided in accordance with the opinion of such Judges or of the
majority (if any) of such Judges.
(2) Where there is no such majority which concurs in a judgment varying or reversing the decree
appealed from, such decree shall be confirmed:
Provided that where the Bench hearing the appeal is 3[composed of two or other even number of
Judges belonging to a Court consisting of more Judges than those constituting the Bench] and the Judges
composing the Bench differ in opinion on a point of law, they may state the point of law upon which they
differ and the appeal shall then be heard upon that point only by one or more of the other Judges, and
such point shall be decided according to the opinion of the majority (if any) of the Judges who have heard
the appeal, including those who first heard it.

99. No decree to be reversed or modified for error or irregularity not affecting merits or
jurisdiction.—No decree shall be reversed or substantially varied, nor shall any case be remanded, in appeal
on account of any misjoinder 5[or non-joinder] of parties or causes of action or any error, defect or irregularity
in any proceedings in the suit, not affecting the merits of the case or the jurisdiction of the Court :
6[Provided that nothing in this section shall apply to non-joinder of a necessary party.]
7[99A. No order under section 47 to be reversed or modified unless decision of the case is
prejudicially affected.—Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of section 99, no order under
section 47 shall be reversed or substantially varied, on account of any error, defect or irregularity in any
proceeding relating to such order, unless such error, defect or irregularity has prejudicially affected the decision
of the case.]
