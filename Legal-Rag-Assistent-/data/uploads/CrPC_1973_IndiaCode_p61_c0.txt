such Magistrate may, in the manner hereinafter provided, require such person to show cause why he should not be
ordered to execute a bond, with sureties, for his good behaviour for such period, not exceeding three years, as the

111. Order to be made.—When a Magistrate acting under section 107, section 108, section 109 or section 110,
deems it necessary to require any person to show cause under such section, he shall make an order in writing, setting

in force, and the number, character and class of sureties (if any) required.
112. Procedure in respect of person present in Court.—If the person in respect of whom such order is made
is present in Court, it shall be read over to him, or, if he so desires, the substance thereof shall be explained to him.
113. Summons or warrant in case of person not so present.—If such person is not present in Court, the
Magistrate shall issue a summons requiring him to appear, or, when such person is in custody, a warrant directing
the officer in whose custody he is to bring him before the Court:
Provided that whenever it appears to such Magistrate, upon the report of a police officer or upon other
information (the substance of which report or information shall be recorded by the Magistrate), that there is reason
to fear the commission of a breach of the peace, and that such breach of the peace cannot be prevented otherwise
than by the immediate arrest of such person, the Magistrate may at any time issue a warrant for his arrest.
114. Copy of order to accompany summons or warrant.—Every summons or warrant issued under section

115. Power to dispense with personal attendance.—The Magistrate may, if he sees sufficient cause, dispense
with the personal attendance of any person called upon to show cause why he should not be ordered to execute a
bond for keeping the peace or for good behaviour and may permit him to appear by a pleader.
116. Inquiry as to truth of information.—(1) When an order under section 111 has been read or explained
under section 112 to a person present in Court, or when any person appears or is brought before a Magistrate in
compliance with, or in execution of, a summons or warrant, issued under section 113, the Magistrate shall proceed
to inquire into the truth of the information upon which action has been taken, and to take such further evidence as
may appear necessary.
