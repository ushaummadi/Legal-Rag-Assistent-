PART I
SUITS IN GENERAL
JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS AND Res Judicata
9. Courts to try all civil suits unless barred.—The Courts shall (subject to the provisions herein
contained) have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature excepting suits of which their cognizance is
either expressly or impliedly barred.
4[Explanation I].—A suit in which the right to property or to an office is contested is a suit of a civil
nature, notwithstanding that such right may depend entirely on the decision of questions as to religious
rites or ceremonies.
5[Explanation I].—For the purposes of this section, it is immaterial whether or not any fees are attached
to the office referred to in Explanation I or whether or not such office is attached to a particular place.]
10. Stay of suit.—No Court shall proceed with the trial of any suit in which the matter in issue is also
directly and substantially in issue in a previously instituted suit between the same parties, or between
parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title where such suit is pending in
the same or any other Court in 6[India] have jurisdiction to grant the relief claimed, or in any Court
beyond the limits of 6[India] established or continued by 7[the Central Government 8* * *.] and having
like jurisdiction, or before 9[the Supreme Court].
Explanation.—The pendency of a suit in a foreign Court does not preclude the Courts in 6[India] from
trying a suit founded on the same cause of action.
11. Res judicata.—No Court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and substantially in
issue has been directly and substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties, or between
parties under whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title, in a Court competent to try
such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been subsequently raised, and has been heard and
finally decided by such Court.
