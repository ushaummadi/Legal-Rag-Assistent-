(2) In the administration by the Court of the property of any deceased person, if such property proves
to be insufficient for the payment in full of his debts and liabilities, the same rules shall be observed as to
the respective rights of secured and unsecured creditors and as to debts and liabilities provable, and as to
the valuation of annuities and future and contingent liabilities respectively, as may be in force for the time
being, within the local limits of the Court in which the administration-suit is pending with respect to the
estates of persons adjudged or declared insolvent; and all persons who in any such case would be entitled
to be paid out of such property, may come in under the preliminary decree, and make such claims against
the same as they may respectively be entitled to by virtue of this Code.
14. Decree in pre-emption suit.—(1) Where the Court decrees a claim to pre-emption in respect of a
particular sale of property and the purchase-money has not been paid into Court, the decree shall—
(a) specify a day on or before which the purchase-money shall be so paid, and
(b) direct that on payment into Court of such purchase-money, together with the costs (if any)
decrees against the plaintiff, on or before the day referred to in clause (a), the defendant shall deliver
possession of the property to the plaintiff, whose title thereto shall be deemed to have accrued from
the date of such payment, but that, if the purchase-money and the costs (if any) are not so paid, the
suit shall be dismissed with costs.
(2) Where the Court has adjudicated upon rival claims to pre-emption, the decree shall direct,—
(a) if and in so far as the claims decreed are equal in decree, that the claim of each pre-emptor
complying with the provisions of sub-rule (1) shall take effect in respect of a proportionate share of
the property including any proportionate share in respect of which the claim of any pre-emptor failing
to comply with the said provisions would, but for such default, have taken effect; and,
(b) if and in so far as the claims decreed are different in degree, that the claim of the inferior pre-
emptor shall not take effect unless and until the superior pre-emptor has failed to comply with the
said provisions.
15. Decree in suit for dissolution of partnership.—Where a suit is for the dissolution of a
partnership, or the taking of partnership accounts, the Court, before passing a final decree, may pass a
preliminary decree declaring the proportionate shares of the parties, fixing the day on which the
partnership shall stand dissolved or be deemed to have been dissolved, and directing such accounts to be
taken, and other acts to be done, as it thinks fit.
16. Decree in suit for account between principal and agent.—In a suit for an account of pecuniary
transactions between a principal and an agent, and in any other suit no therein before provided for, where it is
necessary, in order to ascertain the amount of money due to or from any party, that an account should be taken,
the Court shall, before passing its final decree, pass a preliminary decree directing such accounts to be
taken as it thinks fit.
17. Special directions as to accounts.—The Court may either by the decree directing an account to be
taken or by any subsequent order give special direction with regard to the mode in which the account is to
be taken or vouched and in particular may direct that in taking the account the books of account in which the
accounts in question have been kept shall be taken as prima facie evidence of the truth of the matters therein
contained with liberty to the parties interested to take such objection thereto as they may be advised.
18. Decree in suit for partition of property or separate possession of a share therein.—Where the
Court passes a decree for the partition of property or for the separate possession of a share therein, then,—
(1) if and in so far as the decree relates to an estate assessed to the payment of revenue to the
Government, the decree shall declare the rights of the several parties interested in the property, but
shall direct such partition or separation to be made by the Collector, or any gazetted subordinate of
the Collector deputed by him in this behalf, in accordance with such declaration and with the
provisions of section 54;
(2) if and in so far as such decree relates to any other immovable property or to movable property,
the Court may, if the partition or separation cannot be conveniently made without further inquiry,
pass a preliminary decree declaring the rights of the several parties interested in the property and
giving such further directions as may be required.
